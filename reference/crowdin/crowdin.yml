    # Introduction
    Welcome to Crowdin API v2 documentation.

    Our API is a full-featured RESTful API that helps you to integrate localization into your development process. The endpoints that we use allow you to easily make calls to retrieve information and to execute actions needed.

    Most of the functionality of Crowdin is available through the API. It allows you to create projects for translations, add and update files, download translations, and much more. In this way, you can script the complex actions that your situation requires.

    Documentation starts with a general overview of the design and technology that was implemented and is followed by detailed information on specific methods and endpoints.

    ## Asynchronous Operations
    Methods such as report generation, project build, and file download need some time to be completed and are finalized in several steps. It is what we call asynchronous operations. This  approach allows the application to work without interruptions while the method is running at the background.

    To run asynchronous operations, 3 subsequent API methods are used:
     *     Method to start operation – returns the status __Found__ if the resource you’re requesting is already generated. Typically, __201 Accepted__ status is returned along with the operation identifier. The operation status is then checked with the help of this identifier.
     *     Method to check the status of operation – returns  the completion percentage.
     *     Method to get the temporary link for resource download – mostly used for export operations. When the operation is completed, you can run this method to get a temporary link for resource download.

    __Note:__ Download link is active for a few minutes.

    For example, to download a Translation Memory (TM), you need to run following sequence of API methods:
     *     [_Export TM_](#operation/api.tms.exports.post)
     *     [_Check TM Export Status_](#operation/api.tms.exports.get)
     *     [_Download TM_](#operation/api.tms.exports.getMany)

    ## File Upload
    With Crowdin API v2 all files such as files for localization, screenshots, Glossaries, and Translation Memories should be first uploaded to the [Storage](#tag/Storage). After you upload file to the Storage it will have a unique storage id using which you can then add the file to the project.

    For example, to upload a localization file to your project, you need to run the following sequence of API methods:
     *     [_Add Storage_](#operation/api.storages.post) – upload localization file body to storage at Crowdin server
     *     [_Add File_](#operation/api.projects.files.post) – define where to add the localization file with specific _storage id_

    ## Authorization
    To work with Crowdin API v2 generate the personal access token by going to __Crowdin Account Settings > API & SSO > New Token__

    Make sure to use the following __header__ in your requests:

    `Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`

    Responses in case authorization fail:

    __401 Unauthorized__
    ```
    {
      "error": {
        "message": "Unauthorized",
        "code": 401
      }
    }
    ```

    __403 Forbidden__
    ```
    {
      "error": {
        "message": "Not allowed endpoint for token scopes",
        "code": 403
      }
    }
    ```
    ```
    {
      "error": {
        "message": "Not allowed space for your token",
        "code": 403
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Requests
    All requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods depending on the action required.

    When a request is successful, a response will typically be sent back in the form of a JSON object. If you specify `Accept` header response will be `application/json`. It’s not required to specify `Accept` header so you can leave it empty.

    The API expects all writing requests (_POST_, _PUT_, _PATCH_) in JSON format with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. This ensures that your request is interpreted correctly.

    __Note:__ `Content-Type` header can be different (e.g. `image/jpeg`, `text/csv`) if you upload the file using _POST_ methods with a specified content type.

    RESTful APIs enable you to call individual API endpoints to perform the following requests:
     *     <span class='http-method method-list get'>GET</span> - for simple retrieval of information about source files, translations, or projects. The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests.
     *     <span class='http-method method-list post'>POST</span> - to create or add a new element. This request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object.
     *     <span class='http-method method-list put'>PUT</span> - to update or replace the specific element. This request sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values.
     *     <span class='http-method method-list patch'>PATCH</span> - to edit some specific fields of an entity. With these requests, you only need to provide the data you want to change.
     *     <span class='http-method method-list delete'>DELETE</span> - to remove element from your account. Request works if specified object is found. If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found.

    For example, to edit the name and description of a project, where the requested resource is the project with `id` = 1, the request is the following:

    __Example Endpoint__
    <div class='well well-sm'>
    <span class='http-method patch'>PATCH</span> https://crowdin.com/api/v2/<span class='api-section-block-highlighted'>projects/1</span>
    </div>

    where <span class='api-section-block-highlighted'>projects/1</span> is the requested resource.

    __Content-Type header:__ `application/json`

    __Request body__
    ```
    [
      {"op":"replace", "path":"/name", "value":"Project new name"},
      {"op":"replace", "path":"/description", "value":"New description for the project"}
    ]
    ```

    ## Rate Limits
    The number of simultaneous API requests per account is 20 requests. Response code __429 Too Many Requests__ is returned when the limit is exceeded.

    ## Crowdin API Clients
    The Crowdin API clients are the lightweight interfaces developed for the Crowdin API v2. They provide common services for making API requests.

    You may find detailed information on each client in its respective GitHub repository:

    [_Crowdin JavaScript client_](https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-api-client-js)\
    [_Crowdin PHP client_](https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-api-client-php)


    New API clients are coming soon.

tags:
  - name: Storage
    description: |

      Storage is a separate container for each file. You need to use _Add Storage_ method before adding files to your projects via API. Files that should be uploaded into storage include files for localization, screenshots, Glossaries, and Translation Memories.

      _Storage id_ is the identifier of the file uploaded to the Storage.

      __Note:__ Storage is periodically cleared. The files that were already uploaded to your account will be removed from storage and will remain in your account.
  - name: Languages
    description: |

      Crowdin supports more than 300 world languages and custom languages created in the system.

      Use API to get the list of all supported languages and retrieve additional details (e.g. text direction, internal code) on specific language.
  - name: Projects
    description: |

      Using projects, you can keep your source files sorted.

      Use API to manage projects, change their settings, or remove them if required.
  - name: Source Files
    description: |

      Source files are resources for translation. You can keep files structure using folders or manage different versions of the content via branches.

      Use API to keep the source files up to date, check on file revisions, and manage project branches. Before adding source files to the project, upload each file to the Storage first.

      __Note:__ If you use branches, make sure your master branch is the first one you integrate with Crowdin.
  - name: Translations
    description: |

      Translators can work with entirely untranslated project or you can pre-translate the files to ease the translations process.

      Use API to pre-translate files via Machine Translation (MT) or Translation Memory (TM), upload your existing translations, and download translations correspondingly. Pre-translate and build are [asynchronous operations](#section/Introduction/Asynchronous-Operations) and shall be completed with sequence of API methods.
  - name: Source Strings
    description: |

      Source strings are the text units for translation. Instead of modifying source files, you can manage source strings one by one.

      Use API to add, edit, or delete some specific strings.
  - name: String Translations
    description: 'Use API to add or remove strings translations, approvals, and votes.'
  - name: Screenshots
    description: |

      Screenshots provide translators with additional context for the source strings.  Screenshot tags allow specifying  which source strings are displayed on each screenshot.

      Use API to manage screenshots and their tags.
  - name: Glossaries
    description: |

      Glossaries help to explain some specific terms or the ones often used in the project so that they can be properly and consistently translated.

      Use API to manage glossaries or specific terms. Glossary export and import are [asynchronous operations](#section/Introduction/Asynchronous-Operations) and shall be completed with sequence of API methods.
  - name: Translation Memory
    description: |

      Translation Memory (TM) is a vault of translations that were previously made in other projects. Those translations can be reused to speed up the translation process. Every translation made in the project is automatically added to the project Translation Memory.

      Use API to create, upload, download, or remove specific TM. Translation Memory export and import are [asynchronous operations](#section/Introduction/Asynchronous-Operations) and shall be completed with sequence of API methods.
  - name: Translation Status
    description: |

      Status represents the general localization progress on both translations and proofreading.

      Use API to check translation and proofreading progress on different levels: file, language, branch, directory.
  - name: Reports
    description: |-

      Reports help to estimate costs, calculate translation costs, and identify the top members.

      Use API to generate Cost Estimate, Translation Cost, and Top Members reports. You can then export reports in .xlsx or .csv file formats. Report generation is an [asynchronous operation](#section/Getting-Started/Asynchronous-Operations) and shall be completed with a sequence of API methods.
  - name: Tasks
    description: |

      Create and assign tasks to get files translated or proofread by specific people. You can set the due dates, split words between people, and receive notifications about the changes and updates on tasks. Tasks are project-specific, so you’ll have to create them within a project.

      Use API to create, modify, and delete specific tasks.
  - name: Issues
    description: |

      Issues can be raised by the project members in the Editor and should be resolved by the project managers. Issues could be related to some source strings and translations within the project.

      Use API to get and resolve the reported issues.
  - name: Users
    description: |

      Users API gives you the possibility to get profile information about the currently authenticated user.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |

      Webhooks allow you to collect information about events that happen in your Crowdin projects. You can select the request type, content type, and add a custom payload, which allows you to create integrations with other systems on your own.

      You can configure webhooks for the following events:
       *     project file is fully translated
       *     project file is fully reviewed
       *     all strings in project are translated
       *     all strings in project are reviewed
       *     final translation of string is updated (using Replace in suggestions feature)
       *     source string is translated
       *     translation for source string is updated (using Replace in suggestions feature)
       *     one of translations is deleted
       *     translation for string is approved
       *     approval for previously added translation is removed

      Use API to create, modify, and delete specific webhooks.
